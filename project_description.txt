This file contains documentation for archived code and data for 'Observed Changes in Daily Precipitation Intensity
in the United States' by Ryan D. Harp and Daniel E. Horton (initially submitted to Geophysical Research Letters on
February 25th, 2022). The following guide will detail the origin (whether downloaded or created) of files necessary to
successfully recreate our analysis.

Python modules necessary:
- cartopy
- datetime
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- shapely
- time

Files downloaded and their initial location:
- NEON domain shapefiles: https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data/spatial-data-maps (under Quick Downloads >
    Domain Polygons)
- GHCN station data and metadata: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily

Scripts and their inputs/outputs:
- ghcn_summarizer.py: this script loops through all stations listed in the ghcnd-stations.txt summary file and
    compiles summary statistics and metadata on each station.
    - input:
        ghcnd_stations.txt (downloaded from GHCN portal)
        ghcnd-stations_file_compare.csv (manually created by comparing available file list with list of stations in
            metadata)
        all available GHCN-D station csv files (downloaded from GHCN portal)
    - output:
        ghcnd_summary.csv: list of all available stations and relevant metadata and summary statistics
- station_NEON_assignment.py: this script loops through all stations in the summary/metadata file and determines which
    NEON domain each station falls within.
    - input:
        ghcnd_summary.csv (created by ghcn_summarizer.py)
        NEON_Domains.shp (NEON domain shapefiles downloaded from neonscience.org)
    - output:
        US_stations_with_NEON.csv: list of all available stations within the US and relevant metadata/summary
            statistics, including NEON domain
- daily_precip_stats_spatial.py: this script compiles daily observations for all available qualifying stations
    - input:
        US_stations_with_NEON.csv (created by station_NEON_assignment.py)
        all available GHCN-D station csv files (downloaded from GHCN portal)
    - output:
        *_daily_first_half_pdf.npy: domain-specific aggregation of all daily observations within the early period
            (1951-1980) for qualifying stations regardless of if the station qualifies for both the early and
            late periods
        *_daily_second_half_pdf.npy: domain-specific aggregation of all daily observations within the late period
            (1981-2020) for qualifying stations regardless of if the station qualifies for both the early and late
            periods
        *_daily_both_first_half_pdf.npy: domain-specific aggregation of all daily observations within the early period
            for qualifying stations which have observations spanning both early and late periods
        *_daily_both_second_half_pdf.npy: domain-specific aggregation of all daily observations within the late period
            for qualifying stations which have observations spanning both early and late periods
        NEON_domain_daily_precip_stats.csv: list of all qualifying stations and summary statistics on number of daily
            observations for early/late periods and the domain the station falls within
- daily_precip_moment_calculations.py: this script calculates statistical moments and their change for each
    time period and domain combination
    - input:
        *_daily_first_half_pdf.npy (created by daily_precip_stats_spatial.py)
        *_daily_second_half_pdf.npy (created by daily_precip_stats_spatial.py)
        *_daily_both_first_half_pdf.npy (created by daily_precip_stats_spatial.py)
        *_daily_both_second_half_pdf.npy (created by daily_precip_stats_spatial.py)
    - output:
        bootstrapped_precipitation_daily_pdf_moments_both_median.csv: statistical moments for the early distribution
            as well as change in statistical moments between early and late distributions and results of the
            Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests for each domain. Only includes stations which qualify for
            both the early and late periods
        bootstrapped_precipitation_daily_pdf_moments_first_and_second_median.csv: statistical moments for the early
            distribution as well as change in statistical moments between early and late distributions and results of
            the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests for each domain. Includes all stations which qualify for
            either the early or late period
